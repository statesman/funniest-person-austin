This is a project put together by Dale Roe using [Hype](http://tumult.com/hype/), which was put onto a flat-page in Medley.

It is saved here simply to store the code and to utilize ftpush for publish, which was the easiests option to do from outside the office.

## mobile and social

This does not work well on mobile because it does not resize. I don't know if that is an issue with Hype or just how it was built. Social share buttons are at the bottom, as provided in the flat page.
